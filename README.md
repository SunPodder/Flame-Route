# Flame Route
A web server backend framework written in C

## How to build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will build all parts of the framework and a example server. You can then link the framework to your own projects.

Currently there's no documentation. See `examples/main.c` to have a understanding of how things will work. It's still not fully functional.
