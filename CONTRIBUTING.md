## Contributing Guidelines
Before contributing, please make sure to discuss any major changes or new features with the project maintainers. This is to ensure that your contributions are aligned with the overall direction of the project.

#### Implementing Features
As we are in an early stage of development, we are currently prioritizing the implementation of features over performance. However, please do your best to ensure that your code is optimized and efficient.

#### Submitting Changes
To submit a change, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Implement your changes in the new branch.
3. Make sure that your changes are well-tested and do not introduce any new issues.
4. Create a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## Performance Guidelines
As Flame-Route is a performance-critical project, we have some additional guidelines to ensure that code is as optimized as possible:

1. Avoid memory allocations wherever possible. Use stack-allocated memory or pre-allocated buffers instead.
2. Minimize the use of virtual functions, as they can have a performance impact.
3. Use inline functions where appropriate.
4. Make sure that your code is free of data races and other thread-safety issues.
